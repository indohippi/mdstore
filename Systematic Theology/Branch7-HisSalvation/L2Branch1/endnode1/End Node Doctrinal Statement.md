>[!bug|no-float] Instructions to Contributors
>Before you **leave**, make sure the property boxes (above this section) are checked and names indicate the status of this file. Leave previous check marks and names in place. In other words, if this article is "drafted", then it has also been "started."
>Before you **begin**, Go through the Contributor start-up training in the StartHere document under contributor_resources directory.
Tips: 
>1. **Don't delete or modify any headings**. They are used for automated searching. If you can't develop the higher stage material now (e.g. Logic and Rhetoric), then just leave them blank for now.
>2. Your initial work doesn't have to be perfect, that's what the review process is for.
>3. If you can't choose the perfect verse, list several. Always use the NET version.
>4. Leaf Points are reserved for the most significant points for a young believer. Put other points in the Uncategorized Claims section.
>5. **Keep it short**. If you can't cover a leaf in the recommended word limit, it probably needs to be distributed across different closely-related branches.
>6. Titles need to be very short. (no more than 4 words)
>7. Don't forget to enter tags at the bottom of the article.
