>[!note|no-float] General Instructions to Contributors
>Every page you work on needs a record of your contribution to the page. If you are the first author or first reviewer, you'll enter it with the property boxes (like the one above this section). If you are a follow-on author or reviewer, please record your information in the Metadata section at the bottom of the page. 
>
>Study everything listed below carefully before contributing or editing any pages.



Before you add content or edit any documents, study through the following resources.
1. Study the [[guide to creating content]] closely.
2. Read about different levels of understanding in [[guide for assessments]].
3. Look at an [[example doctrinal statement]] if you haven't already.
4. Know how to use [[markdown syntax]].

Tips when editing any file:
1.  **Don't delete or modify any headings**. They are used for automated searching. If you can't develop the higher stage material now (e.g. Logic and Rhetoric), then just leave them blank for now.
2. Your initial work doesn't have to be perfect, that's what the review process is for.
3. Don't forget to enter tags at the bottom of the article.
