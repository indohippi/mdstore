# General Comments
Questions for the Branch Assessments and the End Node Assessments should carefully consider the distinction between learning objectives at the various branch levels of the Theology Tree. 

Simply put, the lower levels should reflect only the lowest level of understanding as the student is just forming the foundations of faith. At the highest levels, the student should have sufficient experience to appreciate nuances of concepts that allow them to separate complex ideas into parts and compare alternative explanation and interpretations.

As the content becomes more complex at higher levels, different types of questions will be necessary.
# Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Objectives
Benjamin Bloom chaired a committee of educators in 1948 which originated Bloom's taxonomy, a framework of educational objectives. Eventually, the framework was expanded to include Psychomotor and Affective domains in addition to the original Cognitive domain.

It is possible that the 2Tim2 assessments should expand beyond the Cognitive domain and also include the Affective domain. 

In the Cognitive domain (knowledge and thinking), the taxonomy is as follows:
