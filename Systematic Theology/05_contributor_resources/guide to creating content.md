# Understand the Tree Analogy
To better fit your content into context, you need to understand the analogy we visualize in the Theological Tree.

## Basic Structure
There are over 300 End Node Doctrinal Statements on the tree, each with three Leaf Points. These theological tokens are arranged in a hierarchy of branches and sub branches. The trunk of the mature tree carries seven branches. Each main branch carries the three fundamental leaves which were populated in Level 1 (the new believer) plus six new sub-branches. In turn, those sub-branches each carry the leaves which were populated in Level 2 plus six new end-nodes. No one leaf needs to cover broad content because there are a lot of leaves (nearly 1000) to address the breadth of our theology.

## Growth of the Tree Canopy
A new believer begins with a sapling which offers only 21 leaves. They are in groups of three, representing the seven basic area of theology. We realize that the number of theological areas is subjective and various theologians have presented varied models. Seven branches provides symmetry to our tree and draws upon the Biblical use of seven to represent spiritual completeness. 

When the 21 leaves of the beginner's sapling are established, the visualization evolves to the second level tree as shown below. When all the Level 2 leaves are established, the tree visualization will evolve to Level 3 (perhaps, eventually a Level 4).

Establishing new leaves represents growing one's breadth of knowledge. We also aim to represent depth of understanding.

## Depth of Understanding
A believer's ability to understand truth grows as they study the written word and walk with Jesus (The Word). The truths represented by any given leaf must be first presented in appropriate simplicity for the expected maturity level. After the learner builds more related foundational knowledge, they can return to the subject to go deeper. The concession that humans are unable to fully understand anything leads us humbly to rely on the [hermeneutic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle) (which Christians have been relying on since at least the time of [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)). The 2Tim2 learning model fully expects each leaf to be revisited for more depth in the next level tree. 

>[!check|normal] Multiple Levels in Each Leaf
>Each End Node Doctrinal Statement should facilitate the 2Tim2 model by designating three levels of exploration for each leaf. We'll differentiate these three levels according to the Classical Education system as described below. Content should be divided to address (separately) learners in the Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric stages of understanding the concept represented by the leaf

Regardless of physical age, we follow the same fundamental process when engaging a new discipline. This is true for novice learners, intermediate learners, and expert learners. The biggest differences between novice and expert learners is that expert learners know how to learn independently in many environments. This is the goal of discipleship. This is also the goal of [Classical Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_education_movement), whose tenants go back to Plato. Though Classical Education typically is typically concerned with educating young citizens, the "Trivium" model used in it can be broadly applied as a framework for learning in any new discipline. The three stages of the Trivium are summarized as:
### 1. **Grammar Stage (Acquisition of Foundational Knowledge)**

- **For New Learners:** The initial stage of learning any new discipline involves acquiring fundamental knowledge and terminology. This is necessary to understand the basic concepts and frameworks of the field. Regardless of age or experience, learners must familiarize themselves with the foundational elements before they can progress.
- **For Expert Learners:** Even experienced learners must acquire the basic "grammar" of a new discipline. However, their prior experience in learning may allow them to identify and assimilate this foundational knowledge more efficiently. Their existing cognitive structures and learning strategies enable them to connect new information with prior knowledge, facilitating faster acquisition.

### 2. **Logic Stage (Understanding and Critical Thinking)**

- **For New Learners:** This stage involves understanding relationships between different pieces of information and developing critical thinking skills within the context of the new discipline. New learners analyze, question, and explore the logical structures that underpin the field.
- **For Expert Learners:** Expert learners may transition to this stage more rapidly as they leverage their analytical skills and prior experience in problem-solving. They can more quickly discern patterns and underlying principles, making sense of the new knowledge. However, they still need to engage in this phase to fully understand the nuances and complexities of the new discipline.

### 3. **Rhetoric Stage (Articulate Expression and Synthesis)**

- **For New Learners:** At this stage, learners synthesize their knowledge and articulate their understanding, often through communication or practical application. This involves presenting ideas, solving complex problems, and expressing concepts clearly.
- **For Expert Learners:** Experienced learners may excel in this stage more quickly, as they are often adept at integrating knowledge and articulating insights. Their experience in other disciplines can enhance their ability to synthesize and communicate new information. However, they must still engage in this phase to master the specific communication and expression skills relevant to the new discipline.

View the [[example doctrinal statement]] before generating your content. It's important that your content has the following three levels of growth: 
1. brand new believer (possibly elementary age) who may lack the most basic Biblical vocabulary and context
2. young believer (probably young teen) with significant Biblical vocabulary but lacking nuanced distinctions and applications
3. believer who has established all of Level 2 leaves, is preparing for Biblical/Logical defense of their faith , and beginning to build independent safeguards against heresy.
