# What is Systematic Theology?
Systematic theology is a discipline aimed at organizing beliefs and doctrines. It's not an entirely new concept, but modern theologians have refined the discipline. Systematic theology is pursued most prominently in the Reformed tradition with published works by John Calvin, Karl Barth, Wayne Grudem, and John McCarthur. 

Early Church fathers who provided us with systematic addresses include [Irenaeus of Lyons'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Heresies_(Irenaeus), [Tertullian](https://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0160-0220,_Tertullianus,_De_Praescriptionibus_Adversus_Haereticos_[Schaff],_EN.pdf), [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_First_Principles), [Athanasius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_of_Alexandria), [the Cappadocian Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocian_Fathers), and [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo).

In any systematic theology, the design of categories and sub-categories reflects the underlying intent, theological priorities, and interpretive lens of the authors (whether intentionally or subconsciously). This subjectivity should shape the presentation and emphasis of doctrines. **This subjective structure will also influence how readers understand and apply theological truths.**

The question is how do we ultimately want to influence the 2Tim2 users?

# What is a Catechism?
A catechism is primarily an authoritative teaching for instructing believers in their faith. Inherently, their audience includes a broad range of ages and minimal academic requirements. The [Catholic Catechism](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/) and [Westminister Larger](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/westminster-larger-catechism/) and Shorter Catechisms have some of elements of systematic theology. But, they differ in that:
+ they do not dive into as much academic detail
+ their primary purpose is teaching and instructing
+ they do not engage the wider body of debate, reasoning, and detailed exegesis of Biblical texts.
+ the question/answer format is specifically employed to teach a wider audience including children and new believers.
+ they aim to cultivate communal religious life
+ they are intentionally succinct without historical or philosophical elaboration

# So, What's the 2Tim2 Theology Tree?
The most informative label might be "A Private Systematic Theology and Catechism with Hermeneutic Progression." The key distinctions include:
- **Systematic Theology**:
	- We broadly cover all branches of theology (known to us) and organize them hierarchically to lay a comprehensive account of foundational Christian doctrines.
- **Catechism**:
	- We intentional target growing maturity levels to best instruct believers in the fundamentals of the faith.
- **Unique Aspects**:
	- We emphasis progressive deepening in each truth over time rather than trying to capture it all in the first exposure.
